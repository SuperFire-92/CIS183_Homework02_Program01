 RGB Sliders And Lists

Program 01:
This program contains RGB Sliders to create colors based on the user's input. There are three sliders. Each
move from 0 to 255, starting at 255. As the user slides the sliders, the background color of the screen changes
and the hex code changes. When you save the color, it adds it to a list displayed beneath the save color button.
When you click any color within this list, the sliders and background will set back to this color, along with
all text on the screen.
